# chatbotask
Simple chatbot as a test of ask and answer

This was a simulation for a project developed during my internship, where I made an assistant bot for the Health department at Brazilian Aluminum Company (CBA), the final project was not done in python, but it was a great opportunity to learn more about this language .

This project got me certified in Lean Six Sigmas Yellow Belt
